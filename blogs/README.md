# Affable Blogs!

Introduction:
-------------

There are tons of intellectuals out there whose writing has inspired me to what
I'm and what I want to be in my life. This list is an attempt to accrue them all
at one place for easy tracking and also make things easy for others when they
want to track blogs.
