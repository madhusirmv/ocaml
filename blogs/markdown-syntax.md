What is Markdown?
-----------------
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the 
document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists
are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just 
regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like '#' or '*'.

You can use Markdown on most places around GitHub:
+ Gists
+ Comments in issues and pull requests
+ Files with the .md or .markdown extension

Syntax guide
------------
Here's an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or
in your own text files.

#  This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This text will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead

Strikethrough

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.
